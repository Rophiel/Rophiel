Welcome to my GitHub profile! Or did you get lost here? 🧐  
I’m passionate about technology and aiming to become a **Full Stack developer**. Currently, my skills are focused on **Front-end**, but I’m also exploring **Python**. 🐍  
Oh, and a fun fact: I’m fascinated by hardware, but I’m too lazy to dive into electronics. 😅

## 🚀 About Me
- 🐍 Learning **Python** and **Full Stack** concepts.
- 💻 Current expertise: Front-end development with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
- 🎯 Goal: Build complete applications integrating Front-end and Back-end.
- 🤖 Hardware lover, but electronics... maybe later! 😄
